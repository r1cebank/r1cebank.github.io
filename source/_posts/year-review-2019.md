A lot have happened in 2019, and I have decided to make up a habit on recording the things I have done each year so I can look back and see if I had a good year or not.

## Finished Doing

* Made life changing decision by leaving marriage
* Left a job that I no longer feel valued
* Went back to China and visited Shenzhen, Fuzhou, Nanjing
* Wrote a book "Professional JavaScript" and published
* Getting from 90kg to 80kg
* Got a good position at EA
* Had better relationship with parents
* Known a couple friend with similar interests
* Went to Magical Mirai 2019

## Stop Doing

* Eating fast food (zero, that makes you sick every time)
* Excessive spending

## Start Doing

* Exercise more
* Cleaning habits

## Continue Doing

* Learning more about AI and interests
* Learning more about music

It was a wonderful year, and I conclude this review with this wonderful photo I took after the Magical Mirai 2019 concert.
