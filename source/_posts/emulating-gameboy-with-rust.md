It's been a while since I finished the CHIP-8 emulator, the CHIP-8 emulator was mostly capable of running PONG, but at the end I still haven't figured out how to get input work correctly. This time I want to try to experiment with the Gameboy, it will be much harder to emulate given the increased number of instructions and a palette.

## DMG-01

{% asset_img wty35m5y.bmp Gameboy photo %}

Also known as the ‚Äúoriginal gameboy‚Äù

### Hardware Overview
{% asset_img motherboard.png Gameboy motherboard %}

- CPU: Custom 8-bit sharp at 4.19MHZ
- Resolution: 160*144
- Framerate: 59.727hz
- Memory: 8KiB internal S-RAM
- VRAM: 8KiB
- Color: 2-bit, 4 shades of ‚Äúgray‚Äù
- Input Dpad + action buttons
- Serial I/O (Link Cable)

### CPU
{% asset_img cpu.png CPU %}

- 7 8-bit register (A,B,C,D,E,H,L)
- 5 16-bit register (HL, BC, DE, AF)
- 1 Flag register (Z, H, N, C)
- Stack pointer register (16-bit)
- Program Counter register (16-bit)

Also includes:
- Pixel Processing Unit (PPU)
- Audio Processing Unit (APU)

### Graphics
{% asset_img ppu.png Graphic diagram %}

- OAM stores the sprite information, used during rendering
- Palette stores color information, determine how a sprite appears on the screen
- Tile data + tile maps is loaded from cartridge at startup to the VRAM

### Anti Piracy
{% asset_img nintendo.png Nintendo logo %}

- Done in bootrom
- After the scrolling of the logo, bootrom will check the logo stored in the bootrom against the one in cartridge.
- If checksum match, will disable bootrom and jump to the cartridge and start executing.
- If checksum fails, the console will freeze (jump loop)

{% note info simple %}
Due to the logo is copyrighted and trademarked by Nintendo, pirated and un-licensed games will not be including this logo in their cartridge unless they are ready to face Nintendo's legal department.
{% endnote %}

## Building the emulator

- There is no magic. üí´
- Each component is pretty straight forward to emulate if you have the spec sheet.
- We can treat CPU just a block of code that modify internal state + memory when given input
- We can treat the PPU as a block code that takes some internal state and render it to a picture.


### Emulating CPU

```rust
pub struct Core {
    pub memory: Rc<RefCell<dyn Memory>>,
    pub registers: Registers,
    pub halted: bool,
    pub ei: bool,
}
```

- Quite simple if you know the CPU specs already
- Implement every register and instruction.
- Implement a opcode decoder
- Implement clock limiter to limit execution to exactly 4 mhz according to spec

#### Example: INC r/d8

Instruction Decode
```rust
instruction_set.insert(
    0x04,
    Instruction::new("inc b", 0x04, 0, Box::new(increment_b)),
);
fn increment_b(core: &mut Core, _: Option<Operand>) {
    core.registers.b = core.alu_inc(core.registers.b);
}
```

Execution
```rust
// Increment number
pub fn alu_inc(&mut self, n: u8) -> u8 {
    let result = n.wrapping_add(1);
    self.registers.set_flag(Flag::H, (n & 0x0f) + 0x01 > 0x0f);
    self.registers.set_flag(Flag::N, false);
    self.registers.set_flag(Flag::Z, result == 0x00);
    result
}
```
- Instruction decoder will decode the 0x04 value from the rom as INC B (increment B register by 1)
- Inside the CPU module, when this instruction is seen, execute the method alu_inc with the value of B.
- Result is returned to the B register and CPU flags is adjusted according to spec


### Emulating MBC
{% asset_img mbc.png game cartridge %}
- Gameboy has only 16-bit addressing
- For larger games, ROM and RAM needs to be banked so a larger address space can be addressed.
- Many types of MBC exist but common ones are MBC1, MBC3, MBC5

```rust
pub fn load_cartridge(rom: Vec<u8>) -> Box<dyn Cartridge> {
    if rom.len() < 0x8000 || rom.len() % 0x4000 != 0 {
        panic!("Invalid length: {} bytes", rom.len());
    }

    let ram_size_byte = rom[0x149];
    let ram_size = CartridgeRamSize::from_u8(ram_size_byte)
        .expect(format!("Incorrect RAM size {:04x}", ram_size_byte).as_str());
    let cartridge: Box<dyn Cartridge> = match rom[0x147] {
        0x00 => Box::new(Rom::new(rom)),
        0x01 => Box::new(Mbc1::new(rom, ram_size as usize)),
        0x13 => Box::new(Mbc3::new(rom, ram_size as usize)),
        _ => unimplemented!(),
    };

    debug!("Loaded cartridge: {}", cartridge.title());
    debug!("Cartridge type is: {}", cartridge.get_cart_info());
    debug!("Cartridge rom size is: {:?}", cartridge.get_rom_size());
    debug!("Cartridge ram size is: {:?}", cartridge.get_ram_size());

    cartridge
}
```

- Determine cartridge type at 0x147.
- Return an MBC type according to the cartridge type.

#### Example MBC1 read

- Each MBC has address space that is banked and unbanked
- When accessing spaces that is banked, according the spec, we need to adjust the actual address we are reading from according to the current bank selection.
- The implementation uses a Vector<u8>.
- We will need to translate the memory address into an index for that Vector

```rust
fn get(&self, address: u16) -> u8 {
    match address {
        0x0000..=0x3fff => self.rom[address as usize],
        0x4000..=0x7fff => {
            let selected_bank = if self.bank_mode == BankMode::Ram {
                self.bank & 0x1f
            } else {
                self.bank & 0x7f
            } as usize;
            let offset = selected_bank * 0x4000;
            self.rom[address as usize - 0x4000 + offset]
        }
        0xa000..=0xbfff => {
            if self.ram_enabled {
                let selected_bank = if self.bank_mode == BankMode::Ram {
                    (self.bank & 0x60) >> 5
                } else {
                    0x00
                } as usize;
                let offset = selected_bank * 0x2000;
                self.ram[address as usize - 0xa000 + offset]
            } else {
                0x00
            }
        }
        _ => 0x00,
    }
}
```
### Emulating MMU

```rust
pub struct MMU {
    pub boot_rom: Option<[u8; 256]>,
    pub cartridge: Box<dyn Cartridge>,
    pub ppu: RefCell<PPU>,
    pub joypad: JoyPad,
    boot_rom_enabled: bool,
    timer: Timer,
    last_serial: u8,
    work_ram: [u8; 0x8000],
    high_ram: [u8; 0x7f],
    work_ram_bank: usize,
    interrupt_flags: Rc<RefCell<InterruptFlags>>,
    interrupt_enabled: u8,
}
```

- This is a easy part since MMU basically just something that exposes to the CPU and provide basic memory read and write
- The MMU will send read/write command to other components (PPU, APU)
- MMU will also maintain the work ram and timer.

#### Example of MMU read

```rust
fn get(&self, address: u16) -> u8 {
    match address {
        // Last instruction is at 0xfe and its two bytes, therefore excluding 0xff from rom addressing
        0x0000...0x7fff => {
            if self.boot_rom_enabled && self.boot_rom != None && address < 0x100 {
                self.boot_rom.unwrap()[address as usize]
            } else {
                self.cartridge.get(address)
            }
        }
        0x8000..=0x9fff => self.ppu.borrow().get(address),
        0xa000..=0xbfff => self.cartridge.get(address),
        0xc000..=0xcfff => self.work_ram[address as usize - 0xc000],
        0xd000..=0xdfff => {
            self.work_ram[address as usize - 0xd000 + 0x1000 * self.work_ram_bank]
        }
        0xe000..=0xefff => self.work_ram[address as usize - 0xe000],
        0xf000..=0xfdff => {
            self.work_ram[address as usize - 0xf000 + 0x1000 * self.work_ram_bank]
        }
        0xfe00..=0xfe9f => self.ppu.borrow().get(address),
        0xfea0..=0xfeff => 0x00, // Invalid address
        0xff00 => self.joypad.get(address),
        0xff01..=0xff02 => {
            // Serial
            0
        }
        0xff04..=0xff07 => {
            // Clock
            self.timer.get(address)
        }
        0xff0f => self.interrupt_flags.borrow_mut().data,
        0xff10..=0xff3f => {
            // APU
            0
        }
        0xf40...0xff4b => self.ppu.borrow().get(address),
        0xff68..=0xff6b => self.ppu.borrow().get(address),
        0xff80..=0xfffe => self.high_ram[address as usize - 0xff80],
        0xffff => self.interrupt_enabled,
        _ => 0x0000,
    }
}
```

- Basically it‚Äôs just a thing that send read/write operation to the proper devices.
- The range of address for each device is the memory map for the gameboy.


### Debugging without graphics
{% asset_img cpudebug.png CPU debug %}

- Looking at trace log of each instruction running on the CPU
- Look at the register dump to see if the CPU did exactly what it should.
- Efficient when you know which instruction caused the problem
- Horrible for eyesight.
- Copy your CPU code into someone else‚Äôs project and integrate it.

#### Blargg's test

```rust
0xff01..=0xff02 => {
    // Serial
    if address == 0xff01 {
        self.last_serial = value;
    }
    if address == 0xff02 {
        print!("{}", self.last_serial as char);
        input::stdout().flush();
    }
}
```

- Has most of the test roms needed to make sure your implementation is correct.
- Does not require display to show result!
- Test output result to serial, its easy to hook that up in MMU set and output the character written to serial

### Emulating PPU

```rust
pub struct PPU {
    pub interrupt_flags: Rc<RefCell<InterruptFlags>>,
    pub framebuffer: PPUFramebuffer,
    pub tile_set: [Tile; TILE_MAP_SIZE],
    pub video_ram: [u8; VRAM_SIZE],
    pub oam: [u8; OAM_SIZE],
    pub mode: Mode,
    sprites: [Sprite; 40],

    bgp: u8, // Background sprite

    // This register assigns gray shades for sprite palette 0. It works exactly as BGP (FF47), except that the lower
    // two bits aren't used because sprite data 00 is transparent.
    op0: u8,
    // This register assigns gray shades for sprite palette 1. It works exactly as BGP (FF47), except that the lower
    // two bits aren't used because sprite data 00 is transparent.
    op1: u8,

    // Window Y Position (R/W), Window X Position minus 7 (R/W)
    wy: u8,
    wx: u8,

    mode_clock: u32,
    ly: u8,
    scroll_x: u8,
    scroll_y: u8,
    lcdc_display_enabled: bool,
    lcdc_window_tilemap: bool,
    lcdc_window_enabled: bool,
    lcdc_bg_and_window_tile_base: bool,
    lcdc_bg_tilemap_base: bool,
    lcdc_obj_sprite_size: bool,
    lcdc_obj_sprite_display_enabled: bool,
    lcdc_bg_enabled: bool,
    ly_coincidence: u8,
    ly_coincidence_interrupt_enabled: bool,
    mode_0_interrupt_enabled: bool,
    mode_1_interrupt_enabled: bool,
    mode_2_interrupt_enabled: bool,
    horiz_blanking: bool,
    tick_counter: u64,
}
```

- PPU handles all the draw and refresh.
- Has 4 mode, and control registers.
- Has 4 palette that program can freely choose
- Has OAM storage for storing sprite information
- Internal framebuffer for rendering
- Need to support DMA for oam loading
- This video will explain it better than I will ever be https://youtu.be/HyzD8pNlpwI?t=1747

#### Example PPU draw

```rust
fn render_scanline(&mut self) {
    trace!("Rendering scanline, {:?}", self.mode);
    self.render_background();
    self.render_sprites();
}

fn change_mode(&mut self, mode: Mode) {
    self.mode = mode;
    if match self.mode {
        Mode::HBlank => {
            self.render_scanline();
            self.horiz_blanking = true;
            self.mode_0_interrupt_enabled
        }
        Mode::VBlank => {
            self.interrupt_flags.borrow_mut().hi(Flag::VBlank);
            self.mode_1_interrupt_enabled
        }
        Mode::OAMRead => self.mode_2_interrupt_enabled,
        Mode::VRAMRead => false,
    } {
        self.interrupt_flags.borrow_mut().hi(Flag::LCDStat);
    }
}
```

- During HBlank mode we draw the current scanline
- During VBlank mode, the PPU is not using the VRAM anymore, and we can raise the VBlank interrupt to the CPU so it can be handled.
- When we want the mode to trigger an interrupt, we will raise it here as well.
- Interrupt is used often to notify something is being drawn on the LCD

### Putting everything together

```rust
pub struct Emulator {
    pub mmu: Rc<RefCell<MMU>>,
    pub cpu: ClockedCPU,
}

impl Emulator {
    pub fn new(boot_rom: Option<Vec<u8>>, rom: Vec<u8>) -> Emulator {
        let has_bootrom = match boot_rom {
            None => false,
            _ => true,
        };
        let mmu = Rc::new(RefCell::new(MMU::new(boot_rom, rom)));
        let mut cpu = ClockedCPU::new(mmu.clone());

        // If no boot rom is set, we simulate the boot rom states on the mmu and cpu
        if !has_bootrom {
            mmu.borrow_mut().simulate_boot_rom();
            cpu.simulate_boot_rom();
        }

        Self { cpu, mmu }
    }

    pub fn tick(&mut self) -> u32 {
        // Execute one cpu cycle
        let cycles = self.cpu.tick();
        // Update the mmu with the cycles
        self.mmu.borrow_mut().tick(cycles);
        cycles
    }

    pub fn should_refresh_screen(&self) -> bool {
        self.mmu.borrow().ppu.borrow().mode == Mode::VBlank
    }
}
```

- Reading the rom file and decode each instruction
- Hooking up CPU and MMU, allow CPU to directly read write in MMU
- Hooking up MMU and PPU, allow MMU to dispatch read/write to PPU
- Updating MMU and PPU at each clock ticks so interrupts can be handled and data can be updated
- Using a window library to draw the framebuffer from the PPU on screen at each screen refresh.

### Final result
After 2 month of CPU rewriting, and dozen of bugs squashed, the emulator finally able to run games like Tetris or Pokemon Red

#### Running Tetris
{% asset_img tetris.png Tetris emulator %}

- Bootrom works and scrolling nintendo logo appeared.
- Tiles in VRAM is also displayed on screen.
- Useful debug information about the CPU registers is also displayed.

#### Running Pokemon Red
{% asset_img pokemon.png pokemon red %}

### Know Issues

- No APU (no sound)
- Pokemon Red (MBC3) has some banking bug that crashes the emulator
- No Input
- No Serial
- No MBC5 support
- Sprite priority is weird, (sometimes works sometimes doesn‚Äôt)
- Double sized sprite not yet supported.
