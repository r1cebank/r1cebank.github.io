Recently, I formally withdrew from the hiring process at CADDi, a fast-growing B2B manufacturing platform in Japan.  
I applied for a **Senior Software Engineer** position and went through multiple rounds of interviews and evaluations.  
By the end, I realized this opportunity—and the culture behind it—was fundamentally not for me.

Here’s what happened, and why I chose to walk away.

## Interview Process Summary

The process was well-organized at first and included:

- Initial HR screening
- A deep dive with an Engineering Manager
- Two technical rounds (system design & coding)
- A final discussion with the CTO
- Offer discussion and level review

After these rounds, I was given an initial offer:

- **Level: SWE2**
- **Annual salary: ¥8.1M**
- No stock, bonus unclear
- An unexpected “final discussion” scheduled again

## A Sudden Interview… Again

Just when I thought we were entering the offer negotiation stage, I received a surprising message:  
CADDi wanted to schedule **another interview round**, this time after the offer had been extended.

I declined the extra round, pointing out that I had already completed multiple technical interviews.  
They then asked me to **submit a list of past projects and examples** to “demonstrate” I was qualified for SWE3.

I spent hours preparing a detailed breakdown of my leadership experience at Microsoft, EA, and Realtor.com.  
And yet—even after receiving all of this—the company again asked for **a follow-up meeting** to "discuss my examples."

No updated offer was ever mentioned during this time.

## A Conversation That Wasn't What It Seemed

This final meeting felt... off.

Instead of actually reviewing my experience or giving feedback on the examples I’d provided, I was met with a new round of **abstract, loosely-defined questions**—like:

> “How would you speed up the development process at a growing company?”

When I answered by breaking it down into **streamlining policies, engineering practices, and testing infrastructure**, I didn’t get engagement.  
Instead, it felt like they were waiting for a **specific 'textbook' answer**.

Throughout the meeting, one of the hiring managers was **visibly yawning**—repeatedly.  
That may sound minor, but in the context of a supposedly important “re-evaluation” discussion, it felt unprofessional and disrespectful.

At the end of the call, they said:

> “We still need time to consider.”

By then, I had already made up my mind.

## What This Taught Me About CADDi’s Culture

What frustrated me the most wasn’t the level or the salary—it was the **lack of sincerity in the process**.

From the moment the offer was given, I felt I was being brought into a **false pretense of negotiation**.  
But every step seemed geared toward **defending the initial offer**, not genuinely exploring what I could bring to the company.

The engineering manager even told me:

> “Our SWE1s are already quite strong—many engineers we interview don’t even qualify for SWE1.”

To me, that came across not as high standards, but as **self-congratulatory gatekeeping**—and a surprising lack of humility or respect for the broader engineering community.

## My Final Thoughts

I formally withdrew from the process shortly after.  
I believe hiring should be a two-way conversation—not a one-sided evaluation that moves the goalposts every time.

If you’re currently job-hunting and considering CADDi, my advice is simple:  
**Steer clear.**

There are many great companies in Japan building strong engineering cultures—this, in my opinion, is not one of them.
