I don’t really review themes here, but sometimes you come across a really breautiful theme. I normally use the arc theme for my Linux Mint installation. Today I found out that Google is making its Chromebook to run native linux applications and some of the application will have the material theme.

[Chrome OS native app with material design](https://www.xda-developers.com/chrome-os-native-linux-apps-material-design-theme/)

Looks pretty nice isn’t it?

To install just follow the instruction on the github repository [Github](https://github.com/adapta-project/adapta-gtk-theme)

For Arch users you can install it from the awesome AUR

```
yay -S adapta-gtk-theme-git
```
Or if you are using ubuntu based system just use these commands

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:tista/adapta
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt get install adapta-gtk-theme
```

Oh yeah, you might need a change of icon as well, the icon I recommend is: [papirus-icon-theme](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme)

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:papirus/papirus
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install papirus-icon-theme
```
