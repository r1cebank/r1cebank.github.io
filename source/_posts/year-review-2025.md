(What! I haven't finished a single book?)

2025 was such a blur, I still cannot believe it already ended, and further more I am in Japan. I never really imagined stuff to happen this quickly as I start to recall what I did this year. But overall I've had a really good year, I spent a lot of time resting and travelling and finally moved for a different scenary.

High hopes for 2026 and wish this year I am able to do a little bit more than this year. (Hopefully)
