Ever since I took that culinary class in high school, I always loved to cook. During my senior year in college, I even worked as a cook in my school's memorial union. Now I work as a software engineer during the day but when the sun sets, I turns into a passionate cook. I often experiment with various cusines and recipes. Luckly my wife enjoys my food just as much as I enjoy cooking them. From time to time I will post some recipe I am experimenting.

### Cheese toast

I got this recipe from a friend, we were chatting about food and she showed me a picture of the cheese covered toast. It looked awfully like the toast I used to get from that cash only place near where I live. I tried to make this and it has turned out very delicious.

Ingredients:

* Toast
* Light cream (I just used whipped cream instead)
* Sugar
* Cheese slice
* Milk
* Butter

Instructions:

* Mix sugar and little bit of milk until the milk is sweeter than your taste (we will be soaking the bread with this milk)
* Brush melted butter on one side of the toast
* Cover the other side with light cream, this side face up
* Cover the entire toast with cheese, make sure the cheese extend over to the side
* Sprinkle some sugar on top
* Bake for about 10-20 min in 400F oven until the cheese have brown spots.
* Take out let it cool
* Enjoy!
