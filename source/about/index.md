# About

Hello, my name is Siyuan Gao (r1cebank). I am a passionate software developer who always seek advertures in the world of computing. I also love food (eating and cooking) and photography. I love to cook as much as coding. So stick around and you might just able to find some cool stuff around here.

As a software engineer I have used a number of technologies before rainging from C++ to Node.js, here is a list if you are interested :D

* C++
* Javascript (Node.js)
* Rust
* Java
* PHP
* Ruby
* Python

But recently I've been working very closely with Node.js and Python, these are my favorite languages now.

Other than work, I also love to work on side project, using technologies like Docker, React Native and Python with ML, you know, stuff I don't get to work on during my day job. So if you have any interesting ideas, feel free to drop my an email. Maybe we will be building the next big thing together.
